    "在本章中，您将学习如何使用关键词搜索并利用数据库回答问题。搜索对于我们在世界中导航非常关键。它包括搜索引擎，也包括在应用程序内部进行搜索，比如在 Spotify、YouTube 或 Google 地图中进行搜索。公司和组织也需要使用关键词搜索或其他各种搜索方法来搜索其内部文件。关键词搜索是构建搜索系统最常用的方法。接下来，让我们看看如何使用关键词搜索系统，然后再看看语言模型如何改进这些系统。\n",

    "我们先输入\"respnse=()\"，然后在里面设置我们需要的参数。\n",
    "\n",
    "我们需要先明确添加的集合的类型，这里需要添加的集合被称为 Articles（文章），它在数据库中有定义。并且这个数据库中的每篇文章都有许多属性。对于这个搜索，我们希望输入一个查询时，能够返回每个结果的 title（标题）、url、和正文（text）。这里还有许多其他属性，但现在我们不希望数据库将它们返回给我们。因此我们写入\"client.query.get(\"Articles\", properties)\"构建一个查询请求，指定要查询的资源类型为 Articles ，并指定要返回的属性列表为 properties 参数的值，列表里面包含了属性 title , url , text 。\n",
    "\n",
    "接下来处理关键词搜索部分，我们使用\".with_bm25(query=query)\"将关键词查询 query 添加到查询请求中。这将使用BM25算法对查询进行加权，以提高搜索结果的相关性。BM25 是一种常用的关键词搜索或词汇搜索算法，它根据一个特定的公式对存档中的文档与查询进行评分，该公式考虑了查询与每个文档之间共享单词的数量。\n",
    "\n",
    "然后我们使用\".with_where(where_filter)\"将语言过滤器添加到查询请求中，以限制搜索结果的语言，这里我们限制为英文。\n",

    "text:Der Begriff Strukturalismus ist vom Wort Struktur abgeleitet und wurde vereinzelt seit Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts verwendet. In der Psychologie wurde er 1907 von James Rowland Angell in einem Aufsatz über Edward Bradford Titchener eingeführt. In der Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft wurde er seit den 1920er vom Prager linguistischen Kreis verwendet. Dort knüpfte Roman Jakobson an die Schule des Russischen Formalismus an und verwendete den Begriff „Strukturalismus“ erstmals 1929 in einem in der Prager Zeitschrift \"Čin\" auf Tschechisch unter dem Titel \"Romantischer Panslawismus – neue Slawistik\" (\"Romantické všeslovanství — nová slávistika\") veröffentlichten Aufsatz:Were we to comprise the leading idea of present-day science in its most various manifestations, we could hardly find a more appropriate designation than structuralism. Any set of phenomena examined by contemporary science is treated not as a mechanical agglomeration but as a structural whole, and the basic task is to reveal the inner, whether static or developmental, laws of this system. What appears to be the focus of scientific preoccupations is no longer the outer stimulus, but the internal premises of the development; now the mechanical conception of processes yields to the question of their functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "第一阶段的检索通常使用 BM25 算法来对数据库中的文档与查询进行评分。第一阶段检索的实现通常包含倒排索引（Inverted index）的概念。倒排索引是一种具有两列的表格。一列是关键词，旁边是包含该关键词的文档。这样做是为了优化搜索的速度。当你在搜索引擎中输入查询时，你肯定希望在几毫秒内就能得到结果。实际上，除了文档 ID 之外，关键词出现的频率也被添加到这个调用中。\n",
