Canada\n","In his 1990 book, \"Continental Divide: the Values and Institutions of the United States and Canada,\" Seymour Martin Lipset argues that the presence of the monarchy in Canada helps distinguish Canadian identity from American identity. Since at least the 1930s, supporters of the Crown have held the opinion that the Canadian monarch is also one of the rare unified elements of Canadian society, focusing both \"the historic consciousness of the nation\" and various forms of patriotism and national love \"[on] the point around which coheres the nation's sense of a continuing personality\". Former Governor General Vincent Massey articulated in 1967 that the monarchy \"is part of ourselves. It is linked in a very special way with our national life. It stands for qualities and institutions which mean Canada to every one of us and which for all our differences and all our variety have kept Canada Canadian.\" But, according to Arthur Bousfield and Gary Toffoli, Canadians were, through the late 1960s to the 2000s, encouraged by the federal government to \"neglect, ignore, forget, reject, debase, suppress, even hate, and certainly treat as foreign what their parents and grandparents, whether spiritual or blood, regarded as the basis of Canadian nationhood, autonomy, and history\", including the monarchy. Former Governor General Roland Michener said in 1970 that anti-monarchists claimed the Canadian Crown is foreign and incompatible with Canada's multicultural society, which the government promoted as a Canadian identifier, and Lawrence Martin called in 2007 for Canada to become a republic in order to \"re-brand the nation\". However, Michener also stated, \"[the monarchy] is our own by inheritance and choice, and contributes much to our distinctive Canadian identity and our chances of independent survival amongst the republics of North and South America.\" Journalist Christina Blizzard emphasized in 2009 that the monarchy \"made [Canada] a haven of peace and justice for immigrants from around the world\", while Michael Valpy contended in 2009 that the Crown's nature permitted non-conformity amongst its subjects, thereby opening the door to multiculturalism and pluralism.\n","i:1\n","Early modern period\n","North America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in New Spain or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called New Netherland (now New York State.). France colonized what is now Eastern Canada, founding Quebec City in 1608. France's loss in the Seven Years' War resulted in the transfer of New France to Great Britain. The Thirteen Colonies, in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolutionary War, Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.\n","i:2\n","Flag of Canada\n","By the Second World War, the Red Ensign was viewed as Canada's \"de facto\" national flag. A joint committee of the Senate and House of Commons was appointed on November 8, 1945, to recommend a national flag to officially adopt. It received 2,409 designs from the public and was addressed by the director of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army, Fortescue Duguid, who pointed out that red and white were Canada's official colours and there was already an emblem representing the country: three joined maple leaves seen on the escutcheon of the Canadian coat of arms. By May 9 the following year, the committee reported back with a recommendation \"that the national flag of Canada should be the Canadian red ensign with a maple leaf in autumn golden colours in a bordered background of white\". The Legislative Assembly of Quebec had urged the committee to not include any of what it deemed as \"foreign symbols\", including the Union Flag, and Mackenzie King, then still prime minister, declined to act on the report; fearing it may lead to political instability. As a result, the Union Flag was kept as a national flag, and the order to fly the Canadian Red Ensign at government buildings was maintained.\n"]}],"source":["query_1 = \"What is the capital of Canada?\"\n","results = keyword_search(query_1,\n","                         client,\n","                         properties=[\"text\", \"title\", \"url\", \"views\", \"lang\", \"_additional {distance}\"],\n","                         num_results=3\n","                        )\n","\n","for i, result in enumerate(results):\n","    print(f\"i:{i}\")\n","    print(result.get('title'))\n","    print(result.get('text'))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":169,"id":"b1b88822","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["i:0\n","首都\n","每一個國家通常只設立一個首都，因為政府通常會將其重要機關集中在首都地區，以方便政府高層行政和管理，但亦有例外。一些國家有多個首都，一些甚至沒有。有時候，實際的首都和法定的首都由於某些原因並不在同一個城市。譬如，一個稱為「首都」的城市，實際上並非中央政府所在地。反之，所謂的正式「首都」雖然是中央政府的所在地，但可能不是政治決策的地理中心。故此，「行政首都」一般被認定為是該國的「國家首都」。\n","i:1\n","幻想戰記\n","遊戲中存在六個大陸，各個大陸的地圖之間沒有物理連接，地圖與地圖之間的移動方式為點選各個大陸上稱為「戰場」或者「首都」的據點。其中各個「戰場」是可以宣戰的地圖，而「首都」則不能被進攻（也就是說就算任何一個國家的本土被侵佔完畢該國也不會滅國）。\n","i:2\n","首都\n","首都，作為國家政治、經濟、文化的會聚並不是永恆不變的。在古代，國家一般採取中央集權政策，地方勢力有限；首都一旦淪陷，就意味著朝代的覆亡。中國三國時代，蜀漢、吳因失去各自的首都──成都和建業（今南京）而亡國。\n"]}],"source":["query_2_zh = \"加拿大 首都\"\n","results_zh = keyword_search(query_2_zh,\n","                         client,\n","                         results_lang='zh',\n","                         properties=[\"text\", \"title\", \"url\", \"views\", \"lang\", \"_additional {distance}\"],\n","                         num_results=3\n","                        )\n","\n","for i, result in enumerate(results_zh):\n","    print(f\"i:{i}\")\n","    print(result.get('title'))\n","    print(result.get('text'))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cfcd3ed4","metadata":{},"source":["- 英文答案输出的前三个答案并不理想。它们涉及加拿大的君主制、早期现代时期和加拿大国旗。\n","- 中文答案输出的前三个答案相关性更差。它们只考虑了首都，没有关于加拿大的信息。\n","\n","为什么它们会这样呢？因为关键词检索仅仅是在查找与查询有许多共同单词的文档，但无法真正判断出是否这些文档确实在回答问题。所有这些文章都包含与查询有很多共同单词，但它们并非答案。"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7268065b","metadata":{},"source":["让我们扩大下检索规模，要求它返回 500 个结果。为了便于观测，这里不打印文本，只打印标题。"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"id":"6e1b2d2c","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["i:0\n","Monarchy of Canada\n","i:1\n","Early modern period\n","i:2\n","Flag of Canada\n","i:3\n","Flag of Canada\n","i:4\n","Prime Minister of Canada\n","i:5\n","Hamilton, Ontario\n","i:6\n","Liberal Party of Canada\n","i:7\n","Stephen Harper\n","i:8\n","Monarchy of Canada\n","i:9\n","Flag of Canada\n","i:10\n","Order of Canada\n","i:11\n","University of Toronto\n","i:12\n","Newfoundland (island)\n","i:13\n","Liberal Party of Canada\n","i:14\n","Newfoundland (island)\n","i:15\n","Flag of Canada\n","i:16\n","North American Free Trade Agreement\n","i:17\n","Pea\n","i:18\n","Monarchy of Canada\n","i:19\n","Prime Minister of Canada\n","i:20\n","Hamilton, Ontario\n","i:21\n","Aesop's Fables\n","i:22\n","Revolutions of 1989\n","i:23\n","R.S.C.

Second, and perhaps more importantly, because it lay on the border between French and English Canada, Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, which were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.
